# CS321_Project
  - Reading a scheduling data from a file.
  - Create a shared memory of commonly used data.
  - Run and compare among selected six scheduling algorithms concurrently.
  - Execute each algorithm as thread.
  - Each time a job is processed by either of these threads a counter is incremented.
  - Implement locking mechanisms on the critical shared data (Mutex).
  - Output the result to a file.
  
## The project is divided into three phases
### Currently at Phase 1

### Phase 1:
  - Reading scheduling data from a file and implementing three scheduling algorithms.
  - Create the shared memory
