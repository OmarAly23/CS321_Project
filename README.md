# CS321_Project
  - Reading a scheduling data from a file.
  - Create a shared memory of commonly used data.
  - Run and compare among selected six scheduling algorithms concurrently.
  - Execute each algorithm as thread.
  - Each time a job is processed by either of these threads a counter is incremented.
  - Implement locking mechanisms on the critical shared data (Mutex).
  - Output the result to a file.
  
## The project is divided into three phases
### Done with Phase 3: Project Completion

### Phase 1:
  - Reading scheduling data from a file and implementing three scheduling algorithms.
  - Create the shared memory
### Phase 2:
  - Implementing the remaining algorithms 
  - Create the threads for each of the scheduling algorithms 
### Phase 3:
  - Implement the locking and synchronization and output the results back to a file.
  - Finalizing the project.

### How to Run:
  - after cloning the repo
  - * make project
  - ./project
  - The output will be redirected to a text file called "output.txt"
  - to recompile and run the source file
  - make clean
  - which will remove the output.txt and the executable file "project"
  - Go TO *
